A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward.
Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.
For example, is_palindrome("Deleveled") should return True as character case
should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it
reads the same backward and forward.
    def is_palindrome(word):
        return None
